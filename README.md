# MonokStackUp

This repository contains two microservices: **Customer Service** and **Order Service**, which interact through events using **RabbitMQ**.

## üìå Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have installed:
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose**
- **Ruby 3.x** and **Rails 8.x** (if you want to run the services without Docker)
- **PostgreSQL**
- **RabbitMQ**

## üöÄ Setting Up and Running the Services

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/johncuervo/MonokStack
cd <REPO_NAME>
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Environment Variables
The **.env.example** file contains the environment variables that are required for the project with their default values for local development. Use this file as a reference to create a .env file.

```env
# Postgres configuration
POSTGRES_HOST=
POSTGRES_USERNAME=
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Start Services with Docker Compose
Run the following command:
```sh
docker-compose --profile monok-back up --build
```
This will start:
- **Customer Service** at `http://localhost:3001`
- **Order Service** at `http://localhost:3002`
- **RabbitMQ** at `http://localhost:15672` (user: `guest`, password: `guest`)
- **PostgreSQL** as the database

### Known Errors and Solutions

#### Error: Issues When Starting a Docker Profile for the First Time

Sometimes, when starting a Docker profile for the first time, the build may fail for unknown reasons. This issue often occurs because the user has related containers from older versions.

**Solution**

‚ö†Ô∏è  **Caution:** this solution removes all images, containers and volumes that exist in the environment.

To fix this kind of error, it is necessary to stop and remove all old containers. It is even recommended to prune the system and volumes.

1. Stop all running containers:
    ```sh
    docker stop $(docker ps -aq)
    ```

2. Remove all containers:
    ```sh
    docker rm $(docker ps -aq)
    ```

3. Prune the system and volumes:
    ```sh
    docker system prune -a
    docker volume prune
    ```

After performing these steps, try starting the Docker profile again.
